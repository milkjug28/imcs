# OpenSea (router)

Entry point for OpenSea agent skills. Pick the sub-skill based on task, then read its `SKILL.md`:

| Task | Sub-skill |
|---|---|
| Query NFT/token data, search, drops, events | [`opensea-api/SKILL.md`](opensea-api/SKILL.md) |
| Buy/sell NFTs on Seaport, sweeps, cross-chain | [`opensea-marketplace/SKILL.md`](opensea-marketplace/SKILL.md) |
| Swap ERC20 tokens via DEX aggregator | [`opensea-swaps/SKILL.md`](opensea-swaps/SKILL.md) |
| Configure wallet signing (Privy/Turnkey/Fireblocks/Bankr) | [`opensea-wallet/SKILL.md`](opensea-wallet/SKILL.md) |
| Build/register/gate AI agent tools (proposed ERC) | [`opensea-tool-sdk/SKILL.md`](opensea-tool-sdk/SKILL.md) |

Always read the sub-skill `SKILL.md` before executing. This router intentionally has no operational detail.

## Quick decision guide

- **Read-only queries** (collections, NFTs, tokens, search, stats, events, drops): `opensea-api`
- **Write operations** (buy, sell, make offers, fulfill listings): `opensea-marketplace`
- **Token swaps** (ERC20 to ERC20, cross-chain): `opensea-swaps`
- **Wallet setup** (before any write operation): `opensea-wallet`
- **Tool building** (register, gate, monetize AI tools): `opensea-tool-sdk`
